# API Key vs Domain Verification

## ✅ Good News: You DON'T Need a New API Key!

**API keys are account-level, not domain-specific.**

Once you verify `getjobping.com` in your Resend dashboard:
- ✅ Your existing API key will work
- ✅ You can send emails from the verified domain
- ✅ No need to regenerate or create a new key

## What Changed After Domain Verification

**Before domain verification:**
- ❌ Couldn't send emails from `getjobping.com`
- ❌ Resend would reject emails with that domain

**After domain verification:**
- ✅ Can send emails from `noreply@getjobping.com`
- ✅ Same API key, just new permissions
- ✅ Better deliverability

## How to Verify Your Setup

1. **Check domain status in Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Verify `getjobping.com` shows as "Verified"

2. **Test with your existing API key:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-resend?to=your@email.com"
   ```

3. **Check the response:**
   - Should show `getjobping.com verified: true`
   - Should successfully send email

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Verify domain is actually verified:**
   - Check Resend dashboard → Domains
   - Make sure DNS records are correct
   - Status should be "Verified" (green)

2. **Check API key permissions:**
   - Some API keys might have domain restrictions
   - Check if your key has "Full Access" or specific domain access

3. **Test the API key directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.resend.com/emails \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "from": "JobPing <noreply@getjobping.com>",
       "to": ["your@email.com"],
       "subject": "Test",
       "html": "<p>Test</p>"
     }'
   ```

## TL;DR

- ✅ Keep your existing API key
- ✅ Verify domain is verified in Resend dashboard
- ✅ Test the endpoint - it should work now!
