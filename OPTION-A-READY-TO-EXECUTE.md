- All tools available

### **4. TODO List Created **

##  THE PLAN:

### **Week 1: Critical Routes (2 hours)**
- [ ] Migrate `/api/webhook-tally` (30 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/subscribe` (20 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/send-scheduled-emails` (40 min)
- [ ] Fix type gaps in `/api/match-users` (30 min)

### **Week 2: User-Facing Routes (2 hours)**
- [ ] Migrate `/api/dashboard` (15 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/apply-promo` (15 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/sample-email-preview` (15 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/health` (15 min)
- [ ] Migrate scraper routes (45 min)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/redirect-to-job` (15 min)

### **Week 3: Admin & Verification (2 hours)**
- [ ] Migrate all `/api/admin/*` routes (1 hour)
- [ ] Migrate all `/api/cron/*` routes (30 min)
- [ ] Full testing & verification (30 min)

---

##  HOW TO START:

### **When you're ready to begin Week 1:**

1. Open `OPTION-A-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
2. Review the migration templates
3. Start with `/api/webhook-tally/route.ts`
4. Follow the template for complex routes
5. Test thoroughly
6. Commit
7. Move to next route

### **Important Reminders:**

-  **Don't rush** - This is meant to be done over 3 weeks
-  **Test thoroughly** - Each route should be verified
-  **Commit often** - One commit per route or logical group
-  **Don't block features** - Do this during refactoring time

##  REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:

All documentation is ready:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPTION-A-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | Detailed week-by-week plan |
| `OPTION-A-STARTED.md` | Status tracking |
| `lib/errors.ts` | Error handling infrastructure |
| `ALL-CRITICAL-ISSUES-SUMMARY.md` | Full issue analysis |
| `TYPE-SAFETY-ERROR-HANDLING-STATUS.md` | Current state |
| `CRITICAL-ISSUES-AT-A-GLANCE.md` | Visual summary |

---

##  SUCCESS CRITERIA:

**End Goal:**
-  All 55+ routes using asyncHandler
-  Consistent error responses across all APIs
-  All tests passing
-  No production regressions
-  Type safety improved

**Interim Milestones:**
- Week 1: 4 critical routes migrated + type fixes
- Week 2: 10+ user routes migrated
- Week 3: All routes migrated + verified

---

##  WHY WE'RE DOING THIS:

### **Current State:**
-  Only 3.5% of routes use standardized error handling
-  55 routes with inconsistent error patterns
-  5-10 critical type safety gaps
-  Difficult debugging

### **After Option A:**
-  100% of routes use standardized error handling
-  Consistent error responses everywhere
-  Type safety gaps fixed
-  Easy debugging with structured logging

**Result**: A+ codebase!
