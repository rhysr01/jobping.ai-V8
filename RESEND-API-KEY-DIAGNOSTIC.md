# RESEND_API_KEY Environment Variable Issue

## Understanding the Problem

You mentioned `RESEND_API_KEY` is in `.env.local` and Vercel, but the endpoint is still timing out. Here's what's likely happening:

### In Next.js API Routes:

1. **Server-side only**: `RESEND_API_KEY` should be available in API routes (server-side)
2. **Not exposed to client**: It's NOT a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable, so it won't be in the browser
3. **Environment loading**: Next.js automatically loads `.env.local` when running `npm run dev`

### Possible Issues:

1. **Module Load Time**: The `EMAIL_CONFIG` validation runs at module load, which might fail before the endpoint handler runs
2. **API Call Hanging**: The Resend API call itself might be timing out (network issue, API slowness)
3. **Environment Not Loaded**: In some edge cases, env vars might not be loaded when the module first imports

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check if env var is actually available:
The test endpoint now checks this and returns a clear error if missing.

### 2. Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-resend"
```

Look at the response:
- If `hasApiKey: false` → Environment variable not loaded
- If `hasApiKey: true` but `apiKeyWorking: false` → API key might be invalid or Resend API issue
- If timeout → Resend API call is hanging (network/API issue)

### 3. Verify in Vercel:
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Check that `RESEND_API_KEY` is set for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
- Make sure it starts with `re_`
- Redeploy if you just added it

### 4. Check Resend Dashboard:
- Log into https://resend.com
- Verify your API key is active
- Check if `getjobping.com` domain is verified
- Check API usage/limits

## What I Fixed

✅ Added better error messages showing exactly what's wrong
✅ Added API key format validation
✅ Added timeout handling (10s for domain list, 15s for email send)
✅ Added duration tracking to see where it's hanging
✅ Made email config validation defensive (won't crash at module load)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the endpoint** - It should now return a clear error message instead of hanging
2. **Check Vercel logs** - When you deploy, check the function logs for errors
3. **Verify Resend API key** - Make sure it's valid and has proper permissions

The endpoint should now fail gracefully with helpful error messages instead of timing out!
