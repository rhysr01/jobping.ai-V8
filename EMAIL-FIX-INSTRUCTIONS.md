# Email System Issue - RESEND_API_KEY Missing

## Problem
The email test endpoint is failing because `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set in your environment.

## Solution

### Option 1: Add to .env.local (Recommended for local development)
```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### Option 2: Check if it's in .env file
```bash
# Check if RESEND_API_KEY exists
grep RESEND_API_KEY .env
```

### Option 3: Set it temporarily for testing
```bash
export RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
npm run dev
```

## How to Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key (or use existing one)
3. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

## After Adding the Key

1. Restart your dev server:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-resend"
   ```

## What I Fixed

- ✅ Added top-level error handling to catch missing API key errors
- ✅ Endpoint now returns proper error messages instead of hanging
- ✅ Better error reporting in the response

The endpoint should now fail gracefully with a clear error message if the API key is missing, instead of hanging.
