# ¯ Role Type Matching - Now Precise!

##  **What Was Updated**

The AI matching now considers **BOTH career path AND specific role type** for ultra-precise matching.

---

##  **The Problem (Before)**

### **Example 1: Tech Sales vs Software Engineer**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Tech & Transformation`
- Role Type: `Sales`

**Old matching:**
```
 Matched: "Software Engineer Intern" (wrong - user wants SALES!)
 Matched: "Junior Developer" (wrong - user wants SALES!)
 Matched: "Tech Sales BDR" (correct)
```

**Result:** 33% accuracy (1 out of 3 correct)

---

### **Example 2: Data Analyst vs Data Scientist**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Data & Analytics`
- Role Type: `Analyst`

**Old matching:**
```
 Matched: "Business Analyst" (correct)
 Matched: "Data Scientist" (wrong - user wants ANALYST!)
 Matched: "Machine Learning Engineer" (wrong - user wants ANALYST!)
```

**Result:** 33% accuracy (1 out of 3 correct)

---

##  **The Solution (After)**

### **Example 1: Tech Sales (Now Works!)**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Tech & Transformation`
- Role Type: `Sales`

**New matching:**
```
 Matched: "Tech Sales BDR"
 Matched: "SaaS Account Executive"
 Matched: "Business Development Rep - Tech"
 Filtered: "Software Engineer" (wrong role type)
 Filtered: "Junior Developer" (wrong role type)
```

**Result:** 100% accuracy (3 out of 3 correct)

---

### **Example 2: Data Analyst (Now Works!)**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Data & Analytics`
- Role Type: `Analyst`

**New matching:**
```
 Matched: "Business Analyst"
 Matched: "Data Analyst"
 Matched: "Financial Analyst"
 Filtered: "Data Scientist" (wrong role type)
 Filtered: "ML Engineer" (wrong role type)
```

**Result:** 100% accuracy (3 out of 3 correct)

##  **How It Works Now**

### **Step 1: User Onboarding**

User selects:
```
Career Path: Tech & Transformation
Role Type: Sales, Business Development
```

### **Step 2: AI Matching Prompt**

AI now sees:
```
CAREER PATH PREFERENCES:
   Tech & Transformation

SPECIFIC ROLE TYPES (Priority #2 - BE PRECISE HERE!):
   Sales
   Business Development

 IMPORTANT: Career Path + Role Type must BOTH match!
Examples:
  ¢ "Tech & Transformation" + "Software Engineer" = Software Intern/Engineer roles
  ¢ "Tech & Transformation" + "Sales" = Tech Sales/Business Development roles
  ¢ "Finance & Investment" + "Analyst" = Financial Analyst/Investment Analyst roles
  ¢ "Marketing & Growth" + "Content" = Content Marketing roles

CRITICAL MATCHING RULES:
1. Career Path + Role Type Match: BOTH must align
   - Tech path + Sales role = Tech Sales (NOT software engineer)
   - Tech path + Engineer role = Software Engineer (NOT sales)
```

### **Step 3: Job Evaluation**

```
JOB: "Tech Sales BDR at SaaS Startup"
Career Path: Tech & Transformation 
Role Type: Sales 
MATCH SCORE: 95/100 

JOB: "Software Engineer Intern"
Career Path: Tech & Transformation 
Role Type: Engineer  (user wants SALES)
MATCH SCORE: 30/100  FILTERED OUT
```
